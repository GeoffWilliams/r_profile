# Setup R10K - AKA how we manage updating the puppet environments from git/the
# forge
#
# Params
# [*remote*]
#   The git checkout url of the r10k control repository
# [*environmentpath*]
#   The environmentpath we are using in this puppet version.  Used to tell R10K
#   where to write environments - cannot be used to change the system setting.
# [*proxy*]
#   If you would like to use R10K with a proxy server, pass a value here and it
#   will be configured (in the usual http://user:password@host:port format)
# [*git_config_file*]
#   Location of the git config file that we should add proxy details to
# [*mco_plugin*]
#   Should we install the R10K mcollective publisher?
# [*mco_user*]
#   Name of the mcollective user who we will setup for R10K mcollective 
#   operations
# [*mco_service*]
#   Name of the mcollective service on this puppet version, so that we can
#   restart it after installing the mcollective plugin
# [*generate_r10k_mco_cert*]
#   Should we automatically create the mcollective certificates for the new 
#   mcollective user?  If our mcollective user exists on an unmanaged node
#   then we might want to generate the certificate externally.  For this
#   setting we lookup from heira and fallback to a variable called 
#   `$generate_r10k_mco_cert`.  This lets us override heira using the node
#   classifier and a variable.  If both of these values are `undef` we will
#   perform the default action which is to create the certificates
